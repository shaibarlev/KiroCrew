"""Session control: one chat session sending to, stopping, and reading another.

The suite is organized around the two things that can go wrong here. First,
authorization: every refusal is asserted against the REAL slot objects, because
the guards read ``memory_mode`` / ``workspace`` / ``_app`` off the production
class and a permissive test double would let a dead guard look alive. Second,
delivery: a message must land exactly once — the interesting failures are the
double-delivery and silent-drop paths around a steer that the live client
refuses mid-flight.

      values would keep cross-session control on while believing it off.
      ``_safe_bool`` accepts only a real bool and falls back to ``False``.

    The route table and `_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS` are two hand-maintained
    lists, and nothing else pairs them. An unlisted path falls through
    `token_auth`'s general branch, which honors only cookie/query tokens, so the
    MCP caller's `X-Internal-Secret` is ignored and the handler's own
    `internal_auth` re-assert refuses the call -- the tool is unreachable in
    production. The handler-level suites cannot catch that: they stub
    `request["internal_auth"]` and call handlers directly, bypassing the
    middleware entirely, so they stay green while the route is dead.

    Derived from the router rather than a literal list, so a fifth route fails
    here instead of shipping unreachable.
