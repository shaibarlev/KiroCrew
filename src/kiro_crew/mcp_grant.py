"""Presence of kiro-cli's MCP OAuth grant artifacts.

A leaf module on purpose. Four callers need this — ``connections.mint`` (the
curated-provider consent flow), ``connections.status`` (the persisted
connection view), ``mcp_discovery``'s remote probe (any url a user
configured), and the dashboard's disconnect handler (which deletes the pair) —
and each of the obvious alternatives is closed:

* Keeping it in ``connections.mint`` forces the probe into a *runtime* import,
  because ``mint`` reaches the agent and ACP layers and
  ``test_the_handlers_package_does_not_import_the_mint_engine`` refuses to let
  that graph load at gateway boot. A first-time import at request time is then
  large synchronous file IO on the event loop.
* Copying the key derivation into another caller is worse still: it mirrors an
  undocumented kiro-cli internal (``mcp_client::oauth_util::compute_key``) and the
  artifact layout that binary writes, so a second copy would rot against it
  silently. ``test_connections_mint.py`` keeps recorded hashes precisely to make
  that drift fail loudly.

So the derivation lives here, where all callers reach it with an ordinary
module-scope import. Dependencies are stdlib plus ``hooks`` for the audit, which
every caller already imports — nothing here pulls the agent or ACP layers in.

Nothing in this module OPENS a token file: the artifacts are stat-ed for
presence and unlinked by name, so no credential material can enter the process
through it. Deleting them is grant LIFECYCLE management rather than credential
access, and it lives here for the same reason the layout does -- the disconnect
handler is a fourth caller, and it cannot import ``connections.mint`` at all.

    this process. That is the boundary this module keeps -- kiro-cli owns the OAuth
    chain and its store, and the gateway may observe and delete but never read.

    Deleting is what makes Disconnect mean something locally. Taking the entry
    out of the MCP config alone leaves a usable refresh token on disk, so a later
    reconnect silently resumes the old grant instead of asking for consent. It
    does NOT revoke at the provider -- only the provider can do that -- which is

    that fails to unlink is announced at warning level and the pass is retried,

    -artifact failure buried at debug, is what would let a Disconnect delete the
    token, leave the registration behind, and still answer "done".

    """:func:`grant_presence` off the loop, SEL-audited on the acted-on observation.

    The access that owes a trail is the one a caller ACTS on, and ``audit_absence``
    is how the two callers differ on which results those are:

    Tri-state, like :func:`grant_presence` it wraps: ``None`` is "could not look".
    A polling caller treats that as falsy and keeps waiting; a caller that RENDERS
    the answer must not turn it into "nobody signed in".

    * The mint's watcher POLLS for up to its TTL, waiting for a grant to appear.
      Only the TRUE result moves a row to ``granted``; every negative on the way
      observed nothing and changed nothing, and auditing each would write one
      synchronous event per poll for a single flow
      (``hooks.emit_internal_read_audit`` marks the event critical so it drains
      the queue and cannot be silently lost). It keeps the default.
    * The probe READS ONCE and renders the answer whichever way it comes out --
      an absent grant is precisely what turns a row into "Sign-in required". That
      negative is acted on as much as the positive, so the probe passes
      ``audit_absence=True`` and the access is recorded either way. The outcome
      word follows :func:`hooks.safe_read_file_internal`'s vocabulary:
      ``success`` when the pair is there, ``missing`` when it is not.

    A caller that acts on both answers must therefore opt in; the default records
    only the positive, so adding a polling caller cannot silently flood the log.

    Best-effort, NOT fail-closed, which is a deliberate departure from
    :func:`hooks.safe_read_file_internal`. That gate denies on an unrecordable
    audit because a success there hands back live credential BYTES; nothing
    sensitive crosses this boundary at all -- the artifacts are stat-ed, never
    opened -- so denying would convert an SEL outage into a consent that never
    completes after the user actually granted it. An unaudited boolean is the
