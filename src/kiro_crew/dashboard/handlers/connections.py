    """Decide what this Disconnect owns and act on it, all under ONE lock.

    Three destructive acts share one judgement, so they share one read and one
    lock hold: which scopes' ``slug`` entry is actually this provider's, whether
    any OTHER entry shares the provider's grant ARTIFACTS, and -- only if nothing
    does -- unlinking the artifacts. Splitting them is what produced three
    separate data-loss paths:

    * a census that missed custom agent configs revoked a grant an agent outside
      Kiro Crew was authorized by (see :func:`_agent_spec_sources`);
    * a purge that removed the name from EVERY scope while ownership was judged
      from the merged winner deleted a same-named entry in another scope that
      pointed somewhere else -- so the purge now names the scopes it matched
      (``_purge_server_config(scopes=...)``) and no other scope is touched;
    * a revoke that ran after the lock released deleted the grant of an entry
      added in between. Holding the MCP lock across the unlinks is the accepted
      cost of closing that: a config writer waits as long as two ``unlink`` calls
      against the user's home take, which is the same exposure every other writer
      under this lock already has.

    The two questions use DIFFERENT identity functions, because they protect
    different things. Entry identity is ``normalized_endpoint`` on name AND url --
    the pair the card matches on and the rule :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.l1_smoke`
    keeps -- so a user's same-named server at another endpoint is never purged.
    Grant identity is ``grant_key`` equality, because the artifacts being protected
    are FILES NAMED BY ``grant_key``, and the two functions disagree in both
    directions: ``normalized_endpoint`` keeps the query string and strips a
    trailing slash, ``grant_key`` drops the query and keeps the path verbatim. A
    ``?workspace=`` variant shares our artifact pair but is a different endpoint;
    a trailing-slash variant is the same endpoint but a different artifact pair.
    Testing the credential with the endpoint comparator would delete a shared
    grant in the first case and strand a live one (reported as a deliberate keep)
    in the second.

    The sweep reads the RAW specs, not the probe view: ``list_servers`` drops
    disabled entries outside the Kiro Crew scope, and a user's switched-off server
    still owns its grant -- deleting it because its entry is disabled would force a
    fresh consent the moment they re-enable it. The probe view is unioned in so a
    row this census cannot parse still counts.

    FAIL CLOSED, asymmetrically, because the two acts need opposite evidence. The
    revoke needs the ABSENCE of a sharer, which an unreadable source can hide, so
    one unreadable source keeps the grant. The purge acts only on POSITIVE
    evidence -- a scope whose entry it read and matched -- so an unreadable scope
    simply is not purged, and refusing the whole request would leave the user
    unable to disconnect at all because of a file that has nothing to do with this
    provider.

    Reuses the apply path's own config-side uninstall so a Disconnect and an
    ``uninstall`` apply remove byte-identical config rather than drifting into two
    definitions of "removed". A failed agent-config rebuild is logged, not raised:
    the config write has already landed by then, so failing the request would report
    a Disconnect that did not happen.

        ONE pipeline: the string that is screened is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the string
        that is hashed. Round 3 guarded three malformed shapes and round 4 found a
        fourth (a trailing space after an explicit port -- ``urlsplit`` lstrips
        only) precisely because ``normalized_endpoint`` parsed ``value.strip()``
        while ``grant_key`` parsed the raw value, so the screen's guarantee never
        transferred.

        THREE-valued, because two implementations compute this key. kiro-cli
        derives the artifact pair with the WHATWG url parser, which
        percent-decodes hostnames, IDNA-maps Unicode hosts, normalizes
        dot-segments and backslashes, and percent-encodes non-ASCII paths --
        transformations ``urlsplit`` does not perform. Hashing such a URL here
        answers a question about different bytes than the ones kiro-cli hashed:
        round 7 measured ``%6dcp.notion.com`` and ``/a/../mcp`` both naming the
        registry pair over there while missing it here, with no exception
        anywhere. So key equality is asserted only inside the PROVABLE set --
        lowercase-ASCII LDH hosts and printable-ASCII paths free of ``%``,
        backslashes and dot-segments, with no scheme-default port spelled out --
        where both parsers' serializations are byte-identical by construction.
        Outside that set the answer is ``_UNPROVABLE`` and the caller fails
        closed: the grant is kept and the census reported incomplete, because
        deleting on an unprovable comparison is how a live consent dies.

        Within the provable set, ``None`` still means SKIP, on two premises that
        stay sound: unparseable junk (the round-3/4 shapes) can hold no pair
        under either parser, and a provable-charset host that Python's IDNA
        refuses (empty or >63-char label) is serialized verbatim by kiro-cli and
        differs from the registry host, so its key provably is not ours.

        scope labels can be purged, so an agent spec contributes sharers but never
        a purge target -- Kiro Crew does not own a user's agent file.

        TWO passes, because ownership is endpoint-keyed (slash-insensitive) while
        grants are artifact-keyed (slash-sensitive): an owned entry at ``<url>/``
        holds a pair under a DIFFERENT key than the registry URL's, and revoking
        only the registry key would purge the entry while its real pair survives
        -- "Disconnected locally" over a live credential. So pass one collects
        every owned entry's provable key into ``owned_urls`` (registry key
        included), and pass two sharer-tests every non-owned entry against the
        COMPLETE owned-key set. An owned or non-owned URL outside the provable
        set lands in ``unprovable`` and the caller fails closed.

        Sharers are returned PER KEY rather than as one flag: a sharer of the

    """POST /api/connections/disconnect — undo a connection on this machine.

    Body: ``{"slug": "<registry provider>"}``. Three local things: any in-flight
    mint is torn down, then -- in ONE locked transaction -- the MCP entry is
    removed from the scopes that configure this provider and the runtime's stored
    grant artifacts are unlinked.

    Deleting the artifacts is the whole point of this endpoint. Removing the config
    entry alone left a usable refresh token on disk, so a later reconnect resumed
    the old grant silently instead of asking for consent -- while the card had
    already told the user this machine's connection was gone.

    What it deliberately does NOT do is revoke at the provider. Nothing here can;
    only the provider can. So the response never claims the upstream grant is dead,
    and the card keeps sending the user to the provider's revoke page as well.

    ``grantRemoved`` and ``grantSurviving`` are separate answers on purpose: the
    artifacts are a pair, and "the token went" is not the same fact as "the grant is
    gone". The caller is told which one happened instead of inferring it from a
    delete loop's own optimism, and the audit outcome is ``partial`` when anything
    survived. ``grantCensusIncomplete`` says WHY a grant was kept when no sharer is
    named: a source the ownership decision needed could not be read.
