"""Session-directive protocol — stateless session-bound MCP tools.

Some KiroCrew MCP tools act on *the session that called them* — arm a monitor
loop, set a chat slot's project, render a follow-up card. In the unpooled
(gateway-off) topology the MCP server cannot know which session is calling
(one ``kirocrew-core`` serves the whole runtime, and the ``/proc`` walk is
refused because a session-sharing subagent would misattribute to its parent).

Rather than invent a per-process identity source, these tools stay STATELESS:
the tool VALIDATES its arguments and returns a *directive* — a human-readable
confirmation line plus a machine-readable marker carrying the validated payload
(and NO session key). A session-aware consumer that processes the tool result
decodes the marker and applies the effect against ITS OWN session, then keeps
the marker out of what it stores or renders. There are TWO consumers, one per
turn loop: :func:`dashboard.chat_runner._run_chat`'s ``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT``
handler (the dashboard-driven surfaces, which own ``slot.key``), and
:class:`messaging.driver.TurnDriver` (the standalone channel transports —
Telegram, Discord, standalone Slack, iMessage, Teams, Webex, WeCom, Weixin —
whose dispatchers inject a consumer bound to the turn's session key via
``messaging.dispatch.build_directive_consumer``). Both funnel into
``dashboard.session_directive_apply.apply_session_directive``, so the security
boundaries live in one place.

Subagent isolation is therefore STRUCTURAL, not cryptographic: a subagent's
tool result flows through the subagent's own runner, so it can only ever bind to
the subagent's session — never its parent's. There is no walk to get wrong.

FORGERY: the marker payload is model-visible (it comes back as the tool result
text), so a model *could* emit the literal bytes. The consumer defends by
honouring a directive ONLY when the tool call it arrived under was recorded — by
KiroCrew observing the tool CALL — as an MCP-served call whose CANONICAL name
(``_meta.kiro.toolName``, with ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`` set) is one of
:data:`DIRECTIVE_TOOLS`. That identity comes from kiro-cli's out-of-band ``_meta``
channel, NOT the ``title`` (which is LLM-authored prose for shell tools — a shell
command titled ``"monitor_start"`` whose stdout forges the marker must NOT be
honoured). The gate fails closed when ``_meta`` identity is absent. The payload
never carries a session key (the session is supplied by the consumer), and the
consumer additionally refuses native-sub-agent tool calls, which surface as flat
events in the parent loop but have no independently bindable slot. A model
echoing the marker from any non-directive (or non-MCP) tool resolves to no
directive tool and is ignored.
