# Session Control Module

## Overview

Session control lets one of the user's chat sessions observe and interrupt
another: open a new session, stop an in-flight turn, and read a transcript tail.
It exists because a session cannot see what its peers are doing. A session that
has spent an hour on a PR cannot tell whether the session watching the build has
finished, and today the only way to find out is for the human to switch tabs and
look. Session control lets the session ask directly.

Three MCP tools on `kirocrew-dashboard`, three strict-internal routes, one config
switch. Every route is on `_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`; an unlisted one is
unreachable in production because the caller's `X-Internal-Secret` is ignored.

| Tool | Route | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `session_create` | `POST /api/session-control/create` | Open a new, empty session in the caller's workspace, optionally filed into a sidebar folder at creation |
| `session_stop` | `POST /api/session-control/stop` | Stop another session's in-flight turn |
| `session_read_message` | `GET /api/session-control/read` | Read another session's transcript tail + liveness |

**One verb here writes into another session's conversation: `session_send`.**
Reading returns a transcript tail, stopping cancels a turn the way the Stop button
does, creating opens an empty session, and sending delivers a message that the
target runs as its next turn. Delivery is the sharpest verb and is bounded
accordingly: the body is redacted through `sanitize_outbound` before it is
persisted, it is prefixed with a `[sent by session <caller> via session_send]`
envelope so the target's transcript can never render it as something the person
typed, and channel agents are blocked from it outright.

**Delivery has two authorization moments, and only the first is enforced today.**
An idle target runs the prompt immediately, under the authorization that admitted
it. A busy target QUEUES it, and the generic drain re-runs no check — so a target
that gains a channel mirror between enqueue and drain broadcasts the delivered
text. That window is accepted, not overlooked: it is not specific to this module
(a human-typed message into a busy session drains through the same ungated path),
so it is fixed once at the drain rather than per caller. Tracked as issue #5911.

`session_create` earns its place on its own, not as the front half of a delivery
design: an agent that has just worked out that a job needs its own session can
open it pre-named and bound to the right agent, in the caller's workspace, and
hand the person a key they can read and stop. Without it the person does that by
hand -- new tab, retype the title, pick the agent -- and the two observation verbs
have nothing to point at that the agent itself put there. It deliberately does
NOT seed a first message: that would be delivery.

`session_create` also takes an optional `folder` — a folder id or `/`-separated
human path, resolved with `chat_folder_create`'s `parent` semantics (missing
segments created, behind the same tree-shaping gate) — and files the slot as
part of creation (#6118). Filing used to be a second call
(`chat_folder_move_session`), and the window between the two was a real defect
path: a folder deleted in between left the session unfiled with the create
already done. The handler assigns `folder_id` inside the same synchronous window
that configures the slot, holds `suspend_slots_push` across the whole
allocation-to-persist span (so the slot's first broadcast frame already shows it
filed, and a slot whose birth write fails is never broadcast at all), and
carries the placement in the persist-at-birth metadata, so no caller or client
ever observes an unfiled session and the placement survives a restart.
An unresolvable folder refuses the whole create — nothing exists yet, so refusal
loses nothing — existence is confirmed read-only under the folder-store lock
(`read_folders`) before the allocation, and the move path's Model-B un-hide runs
only after the filing has landed, so a refused create leaves no folder-tree
mutation behind.

`kirocrew-dashboard` rather than `kirocrew-core`, because these tools are not a
capability every session should carry. That server is an **assignable set**: it
is absent from the default agent's spec and loads only for an agent whose own
spec references it, so an ordinary session spends no context on tools it will
never call. The set already holds the chat-folder tools, and the two classes are
granted together on purpose — an agent given the job of organizing sessions is
the same agent that should be able to see what they are doing. A test pins that
bundling so neither half can leave the set unnoticed.

Discovery is not new: `list_sessions` already enumerates the caller's sessions,
and its keys are what `target` accepts.

## Authorization

Deny-by-default, and checked in **one** place — `authorize_target` — for the two
verbs that take a target, so a guard cannot be present on `stop` and missing on
`read`. (`session_create` has no target to authorize; it checks the caller's own
eligibility with the same refusals.) Every refusal is recorded in the SEL as
`session_control.<op>` with `outcome=denied`, so an attempt to reach a session
that is out of bounds is visible after the fact even though nothing happened.

| Refusal | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Config switch off (`agent.session_control`) | 403 | Operator opted out |
| Caller session cannot be identified | 403 | An unidentifiable caller makes the self-target guard blind |
| Caller is an unattended session (`cron-*`, `workflow-*`) | 403 | A scheduled job acting on live conversations is not a handoff |
| Caller is itself incognito, temporary, or app-scoped | 403 | Caller-side isolation — the direction the target-side checks cannot see |
| Caller is channel-linked (`linked_session_key` set) | 403 | The exfiltration direction: a linked caller's conversation IS a channel thread, so a read would hand a private dashboard transcript to that channel's readers. `CHANNEL_AGENT_BLOCKED_TOOLS` keys on the agent identity; a linked slot is a second route to the same surface |
| Caller's own session is no longer open | 403 | Nothing to attribute the operation to |
| Caller changed workspace while a creation was in flight | 403 | Creation resolves the workspace's project directory off-loop, so it suspends between authorizing the caller and allocating the slot. Both decisions that read the caller's workspace -- the memory boundary the child inherits, and whether the answering agent is bound to that workspace -- are invalidated by a move, and re-deciding the binding here is not available: it needs a config load, which must not run on the event loop |
| Named agent does not resolve to a configured one | 403 | The resolver falls back to the default agent, which passes the workspace check because it is the caller's own default -- so no boundary is crossed, but the created session would store and advertise a name that is not what answers. `ResolvedBindings.requested_resolved` states that contract for callers that store the requested name. Refused rather than rewritten to the effective agent: nothing exists yet, so a corrected name costs one retry, whereas an existing slot keeps its stored name verbatim so a momentarily stale resolution cannot permanently rebind it |
| Target is the caller | 403 | A session controlling itself has no exit |
| Target is unattended (`cron-*`, `workflow-*`) | 403 | A `workflow-<run_id>` slot is display-only and a cron's turns are driven by a schedule |
| Target is incognito or temporary | 403 | Never addressable, matching `list_sessions` |
| Target is app-scoped | 403 | App sessions are the app's, not a peer's |
| Target is channel-linked (`linked_session_key` set) | 403 | Its conversation is mirrored to Slack/Telegram, so reaching it crosses a surface boundary both ways — and its stop cannot be honoured, because the stop path addresses `dashboard:<slot>` while a linked slot's turns run under its linked key |
| Target or caller has an outbound channel mirror (`get_mirror_link`) | 403 | The same boundary reached by the other mechanism. `linked_session_key` marks a channel-BORN slot; a dashboard-born slot given a mirror link republishes its turns to a channel just as surely, and the link lives in the session store rather than on the slot, so the slot-side check reads empty on exactly the session that mirrors |
| Target is a crew-mode session (`mode == "crew"`) | 403 | A crew session's turn lifecycle is not the dashboard's: `/api/chat` routes its input to `state.crew.ingest`, which makes a durable queue entry and fans it out to topic sub-sessions. Refused rather than emulated — a target whose lifecycle differs needs its own handling, not a second copy of the orchestrator's rules |
| Target is in another workspace | 403 | Workspaces are the memory boundary |
| Target names no open session | 404 | A mistake, not an authorization failure |
| Title matches more than one session | 409 | Guessing means acting on the wrong conversation |

Two notes on scope:

- **Only sessions the dashboard currently holds are addressable.** A closed tab
  is out of reach on purpose — waking one would resurrect a conversation the
  user put away. This is narrower than `list_sessions`, which also lists history.
- **All three tools are on `CHANNEL_AGENT_BLOCKED_TOOLS`, including the read.** A
  channel agent is contained to channel posts, and session control crosses that
  boundary in both directions: a stop reaches the user through one of their
  dashboard transcripts, and `session_read_message` pulls a private dashboard
  conversation into a channel other humans can see. Containment is about what
  crosses the boundary, not about who writes, so the read is blocked alongside
  the rest. `session_create` earns its place for a different reason: it writes
  nothing into an existing conversation, but it puts a persistent,
  sidebar-visible session outside that containment.

All three tools additionally require a **signed** caller identity
(`_resolve_session_key_strict`), not the lenient `/proc` ancestor walk. A
subagent spawned by `spawn_run` lives under its parent slot's process tree, so
the walk resolves it to the parent — and since authorization here is entirely
"what may this session reach", that would let a subagent read or stop the
parent's sibling sessions. A caller the gateway issued no key to is refused with
an explanation rather than silently borrowing one.

The routes are **strict-internal** (`_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`): loopback plus
`X-Internal-Secret`, with no cookie fall-through. No browser calls them, and they
are the entry point to opening, stopping, and reading another live conversation —
a cookie path there would be a new authorization surface rather than a
convenience. The MCP process holds the secret; an agent's own sandbox does not
(`KIROCREW_INTERNAL_SECRET` is stripped from agent env), which is why these are
tools rather than something an agent can curl.

Each handler **re-asserts** `request["internal_auth"] is True` rather than
trusting the path classification. Strict is not self-enforcing at the handler:
with the header absent the middleware falls through to cookie auth, and a
`local_only=False` deployment reclassifies strict paths as mixed. Because these
routes authorize on the `X-Session-Key` the caller supplies, a same-origin page
holding only a dashboard cookie could otherwise act **as** any of the user's
sessions. `internal_auth` is set only after a constant-time secret match, so one
check closes the cookie path, the app-token path, and the non-loopback
reclassification together. The same reasoning is why
`/api/computer-use/frame` re-asserts it.

The config read fails **closed**: `KiroCrewConfig.load()` raising resolves to
disabled, which is also the field's own default, so neither a malformed unrelated
section nor a missing setting can produce cross-session reach.

## The wait → read poll loop

`session_read_message` is the observation half, and polling is the supported
shape:

1. `session_read_message(target)` — record `next_since`.
2. `wait(seconds=…)`.
3. `session_read_message(target, since=<previous next_since>)` — returns only what
   arrived since, so a loop does not re-read the same messages.

`total` is an **absolute position** in the session, not the length of the live
window. A slot retains only its most recent messages in memory and credits each
trimmed row to a frozen-prefix counter, so a length-derived cursor would freeze
at the retention cap — and a poller on a long session would silently stop seeing
replies, on exactly the sessions that need it most. A `since` read on a session
whose rows have aged out is refused with `cursor_unavailable` (409) rather than
fast-forwarded onto newer rows as if they were the ones asked for: the position
is no longer exact, so answering it would be a guess dressed as an answer. The
caller falls back to a tail read, which is why `next_since` is omitted in that
case — its absence IS the signal that cursors are not available.

`running` is what makes the loop terminable: `running: false` with an empty
window means the target finished and went idle, which is different from "nothing
new yet". `queue_depth` reports how much the target still owes.

The cursor deliberately stops **before the streaming tail**. `chat_runner`
appends a `chunk` row per token burst and `_flush_segment` then deletes that
trailing run, replacing it with one durable assistant message — so chunk rows are
always a suffix, never interleaved. Counting them would inflate `total`, the
flush would shrink the list back under it, and the next `since=next_since` read would
skip the finished reply permanently. A read taken mid-reply therefore reports
`streaming: true`, so an empty window while the target is composing is
distinguishable from an empty window because nothing is happening.

A stale cursor is refused, not clamped. A compacted or rewound transcript shrinks,
so a `since` past the end answers 409 `cursor_unavailable` and the caller falls
back to a tail read. Clamping it to the end would look friendlier and lose data:
the rows below the clamp are what replaced the old tail, a cursor never moves
backwards, so they would be skipped permanently while the response read as
"nothing new". A cursor exactly AT the end is not stale and still returns an empty
window.

## Configuration

`agent.session_control` (bool, default **false**). Off makes all three tools
refuse with a message naming the switch, so an agent that has not been granted it
reports why rather than failing silently.

Default-off is the deliberate part. The three tools ride on the existing
assignable `kirocrew-dashboard` server rather than a new one, so an operator who
had already assigned that server to an agent for folder organization would
otherwise find that agent able to read peer transcripts and stop peer turns purely
by upgrading. Every target is still one of the user's own sessions on their own
machine, reached over loopback with an audited internal secret -- the objection is
not that the capability is dangerous but that it would arrive without anyone
granting it. Making it an explicit switch costs one setting and buys a grant that
matches what the operator actually chose.

Both absent and malformed values resolve to disabled. `_safe_bool(..., False)`
handles the malformed case -- `bool("false")` is `True`, so a user who wrote the
value in an editor that quotes it would otherwise get the opposite of what they
read -- and the lookup now supplies `False` for the absent case, so nothing has to
infer a grant from silence.

## What is deliberately not here

- **No delivery to a target outside the addressable set.** `session_send` writes
  into another session's conversation, but only one the same `authorize_target`
  guard admits: a channel-linked, channel-mirrored, crew-mode, incognito,
  app-scoped, unattended or cross-workspace target is refused, so the verb cannot
  reach a conversation other people are party to. The residual is the queued arm's
  second authorization moment, recorded above and tracked as #5911.
- **No cross-workspace or cross-machine reach.** The boundary is one gateway's
  live sessions in one workspace.
- **No waking closed sessions.** See above.
- **No writes on the read path.** `session_read_message` never changes the
  target's state, so a poll loop cannot perturb what it is measuring.
