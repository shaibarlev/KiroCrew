# Babysit PR Watch

Status: implemented (this PR)
Owners: babysit builtin skill (`builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/babysit/`), on the
interrupt controller in `irq.py` (see `agent-interrupt-controller.md`)

## 1. Problem

A PR babysit spends most of its life waiting. The `monitor_start` loop that
drives it re-injects a full agent turn every cycle — session context included —
and on a quiet PR the turn's entire output is "nothing changed". Measured on
real babysit sessions: roughly two thirds of cycles were pure status checks
that needed no judgment, while a saturated session pays a context-window-scale
input bill to produce each of them. The check itself is deterministic
(`gh pr view` and a diff against the last observation); only the *reaction*
to a change needs a brain.

## 2. Solution overview

Split detection from judgment:

- **Detection** becomes a zero-token `script` cron
  (`babysit/scripts/pr_watch.py`) polling one PR every few minutes. Quiet
  ticks raise `Skip` — no delivery, no tokens, no transcript growth.
- **Judgment** stays in the babysit session. On an unexpected state the
  script raises `Report`, and the existing script-cron delivery path
  (`_deliver_script_result`) injects the brief into the session that armed
  the cron **as a real agent turn** (queued if a turn is running, spawned if
  idle). No gateway changes: the wake primitive already exists.
- **Terminal states** (merged, closed) raise `Done`: one final message, and
  the cron removes itself.

The babysit skill's decision table gains a watch-mode branch: `monitor_start`
for phases where the agent acts most cycles, the watch cron for pure-wait
phases, and an explicit composition pattern for switching between them.

The generic half of that split now lives in `kiro_crew.irq`, the interrupt
controller: state identity, masking, epoch resets, the coalescing window and
the error backstop. This file is its first probe and owns only the two GitHub
decisions — how to observe a pull request, and what counts as an anomaly. The
probe never raises `Skip` / `Report` / `Done`; it returns a `Tick` of
`Observation`s and the kernel raises the verdict.

## 3. Wake predicates

Each fires once per dedupe window (while a condition persists, the alert
re-arms after a few hours — the script cannot observe delivery, so dedupe is
time-bounded rather than a permanent acknowledgement, and a delivery lost to
a gateway failure costs a bounded delay, never a permanently suppressed
signal). Check-derived predicates are additionally scoped **per head SHA**, so
a force-push resets their memory immediately; conversation predicates are not,
because a comment is not a property of the commit (see below):

| Reason | Trigger | Why it needs a brain |
|---|---|---|
| `conflict` | `mergeable` CONFLICTING / `mergeStateStatus` DIRTY | Checks freeze on a dirty PR; waiting observes nothing. Rebase needed. |
| `new-red` | A check in a failing bucket whose name is not in `known_reds` and not yet alerted for this head | Read the job log / reviewer comment for the current head; run conclusions alone are unreliable. |
| `ready` | Zero pending and zero failing after the `known_reds` filter, non-empty rollup | Verify reviewer verdicts on this head and tell the user. Suppressed with `wake_on_green: false`. |
| `watch-error` | `gh` failed several consecutive ticks | The watch is blind (expired auth, network); it says so once instead of rotting silently. |

`known_reds` carries the check names that are red on the base branch itself —
the inherited-breakage filter that a human babysitter applies mentally. The
watch never wakes for them, and counts them as green for the `ready`
predicate. The probe filters them inside `observe()` and does not return them
as observations at all. `known_reds` matches EITHER the bare check name (what
an operator reads off GitHub's UI) or the workflow-qualified spelling the alert
key uses, so a hand-written allow-list works while two workflows sharing a
check name stay distinguishable.

`new-red` and `ready` are **coalesced**; `conflict` is an `NMI` and fires
immediately. The distinction is not importance but whether waiting can produce
more information: a dirty PR dispatches no checks, so its `pending` count never
drains and delaying the conflict signal would strand the operator on something
already actionable.

Coalescing was added because of a measured defect, not a hypothesis. Before it,
`new-red` fired on the first failing check with no gate on `pending`. On this
repository — roughly sixty-five checks finishing over about twenty minutes — one
head woke the operator twice within four minutes, at 34 seconds for a body gate
and at 4m55s for a reviewer lane, while twenty-four checks were still running.
Neither wake could act: the first turn did not know whether more failures were
coming, and both would have been serviced by the same edit and the same push.
Notably a full read of the same file concluded it had no defects — the fault is
a property of real CI timing, not of the code, and only running it exposed it.

The conversation IS watched -- comments, submitted reviews, and the overall
`reviewDecision` -- but only as *events*. The probe reports that something was
said, naming the author and the timestamp, and never quotes the body. Reading
the text, deciding whether a verdict is real, checking marker freshness and
composing a rebuttal remain the woken agent's job, done with the session's own
trust rather than a cron script's. That boundary is what keeps the judgment this
design exists to stop paying for per-cycle out of the script, while still
closing the gap that made the watch insufficient on its own: a comment moves no
check, and a reviewer lane on this repository can report success while its
comment body carries findings, so a rollup-only watch sits quiet on a green PR
nobody has read.

Two consequences of watching a conversation rather than a commit:

- Conversation dedupe keys are **epoch-independent** (`epoch_scoped=False`) and
  survive the force-push reset. A comment belongs to the pull request, not to
  the commit under review, so pushing a fix minutes after a review must not
  replay that review.
- Comments the watcher's own account authored are ignored (`viewerDidAuthor`).
  Without that the watch is a feedback loop: the woken agent posts a
  disposition, the next tick sees a new comment and wakes it to read what it
  just wrote.
- A signal older than `comment_horizon_secs` (default 1h) is never new. The
  probe holds no state of its own, so the horizon is what stops arming a watch
  on a long-discussed PR from reporting its whole history on the first tick.

CANCELLED check runs are classified as noise (force-push twins and re-run
leftovers dominate); the rare real one surfaces through the checks it cancelled
around.

## 4. Mechanics

- **Script home**: `builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/babysit/scripts/pr_watch.py`,
  synced to the user's skills directory by the builtin-skills loader like
  every other bundled skill asset. It is a cron-only script: never imported
  by gateway code. Cron scripts must live under `<config_dir>/crons/`
  (`resolve_script_path` enforces the root, and a symlink out of it is
  rejected after resolution), so the skill's arm recipe copies the synced
  asset into `crons/` on every arm — keeping the copy current — and registers
  `cron_add(script=".../crons/pr_watch.py:watch", every=300, timeout=120,
  message=<JSON>)`. The script body is security-scanned at registration and
  sandboxed at execution like any other script cron.
- **gh inside the sandbox**: the script-cron sandbox is a single-uid Linux
  user namespace, so every root-owned path component (`/`, `/usr`, `/home`)
  stats as the overflow uid and `resolve_gh`'s ownership walk would refuse
  ANY gh on the host. The gateway therefore pre-resolves gh with the full
  validation OUTSIDE the sandbox and hands the child
  `_KIROCREW_GH_PREVALIDATED=<path>|<st_dev>:<st_ino>`; the child re-checks
  what the namespace leaves intact (regular file, executable, not
  world-writable, outside the agent-writable tree) and pins the device:inode
  identity, so a binary swapped after the parent's check is refused. Hosts
  without a usable gh omit the variable and the child fails with the
  ordinary setup message.
- **Polling**: one bounded `gh pr view --json
  state,mergedAt,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,headRefOid,statusCheckRollup`
  call per tick (25s subprocess timeout). The rollup is bucketed tolerantly
  across the CheckRun and StatusContext shapes; unknown conclusion vocabulary
  buckets as failing — when in doubt, wake a brain.
- **State**: owned by the kernel at
  `<data home>/watch/gh-pr/<subject-fold>-<digest>.json`, where the digest
  covers `gh-pr#<repo>#<pr>#<cron job id>` — so two sessions babysitting one PR
  keep independent alert memories and neither can suppress the other's
  delivery. It holds the last head (the kernel's `epoch`), the per-head alert
  memory, the consecutive-error streak, and any open coalescing window.
  Corrupt or missing state reads as fresh; the cost of lost state is one
  duplicate wake, never a lost signal. **This path differs from the previous
  `<data home>/pr-watch/...`**, so the first tick after upgrading is a cache
  miss and any currently-open anomaly wakes once more. That is expected, not a
  regression.
- **Wake targeting**: the cron must be armed FROM the babysit session — the
  cron system captures the calling session key at `cron_add` time and the
  delivery path resolves it back to that slot (rehydrating it from history if
  the tab was closed). Armed headless, delivery degrades to a bell
  notification.
- **Wake brief**: names the PR, head, reason, and the caller-supplied `note`
  (worktree/branch orientation), and directs the woken turn to read the
  session work ledger when one exists — pairing with the session-ledger
  feature so a cold wake resumes from durable state.
- Check names are attacker-influenceable text (a workflow names its jobs);
  they are charset-folded before entering state keys or the wake brief.

## 5. Non-goals

- **Replacing `monitor_start` entirely.** Watch mode now covers the whole
  waiting phase, conversation included, so a PR babysit no longer needs a nudge
  loop merely to notice a comment. Two things still keep `monitor_start`: an
  active-fix phase, where the next step is driven by the agent's own unfinished
  work rather than by anything observable on the PR, and watching subjects that
  are not pull requests at all (a deployment, a ticket, someone else's CI run).
  Retiring it for those needs a probe each, which is not this feature.
- **Parsing verdict text in the watcher.** See §3: the probe reports that a
  comment or review exists, never what it says.
- **Multi-PR watches.** One cron per PR; the state file and the wake brief
  are per-PR, and `cron_list` stays legible.
- **A new wake primitive.** The script-cron `Report` delivery path already
  injects an agent turn into the origin session; this feature adds zero
  gateway surface.

## 6. Failure modes

- `gh` failure → silent `Skip` per tick, one `watch-error` wake after the
  streak threshold, streak reset on recovery.
- Malformed cron message (bad JSON, missing repo/pr) → `Done` with the
  reason: a watch that can never succeed removes itself instead of retrying
  forever.
- State file unwritable → alerts may repeat (duplicate wake), never lost, and
  every wake carries a warning naming the directory. If the probe is failing
  *and* state cannot persist, the streak can never accumulate, so that case
  reports on the first tick instead of waiting for a threshold it will never
  reach.
- **Coalescing costs at least one extra tick**, because a window cannot open
  and fire within the same tick — `elapsed` is zero at the moment it opens. On
  a 60-second cron that is at least 60 seconds of added latency. Set
  `coalesce_secs: 0` in the cron message when latency matters more than being
  woken once.
- `pending` never draining (a check wedged in queued, a phantom pending row) →
  the window fires at the `coalesce_max_secs` wall instead, which is measured
  from the first anomaly and independent of `pending`. A new anomaly arriving
  after that starts a fresh window, so under a permanently stuck `pending`
  count the worst case is one wake per hard-cap interval — delayed, never
  dropped.
- Session tab closed → the delivery path rehydrates the slot from history;
  if the session's history was permanently deleted, delivery degrades to a
  bell notification.
